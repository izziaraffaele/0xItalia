Ninfa.io is a **curated multi-category retailer** for personalizing your digital identity via digital art and collectibles enabled by NFTs on Ethereum Blockchain.

# Curated

**Curated** in the sense that artists need to be approved before being able to join our marketplace and mint their pieces.

However, we feel that the current platform’s curation style is not objective enough. We have asked ourselves: how can a marketplace rely only on its internal team of curators to select artists? How can it be sure to find all the hidden talent in the ecosystem? How can it ensure fairness regarding talents’ geographical, gender and art genre distribution? It can’t.

This is why Ninfa adopted the **first expertise-based collaborative approach to curation**. Curators and **Art Galleries, Design Studios and Brands have a dedicated user type** which can onboard artists on the platform as we do with independent artists. These user types can also manage their artists’ artworks, create exhibitions, sell pieces, earn cut from their sales, and, in case they need, drop NFTs as a brand.

# Multi-category

Ninfa is **multi-category** because we feel that individuals will need a platform covering many different needs including but not limited to art, e.g. digital fashion, avatars, and design objects. That is why our vision is **“Expanding Identities Beyond Physical Boundaries”.**

The world is becoming more and more digital as we speak. Especially after the covid pandemic, many human interactions and basic human activities are conducted entirely digitally or somehow impacted/enhanced by digital technologies.

This is the metaverse to us, not necessarily a Virtual World, but the constant and permanent presence of digital means in our life. In this context, it is evident that our digital selves are getting more and more important. But digital avatars, especially before NFTs, tend to be standardized accounts rather than personalities. **Thus, individuals will feel the need to define their digital persona further and transmit all their tastes, preferences and habits to their digital equivalents**. How?

**There is no better way to express ourselves than collecting**: items, artworks, collectables, PFPs or acquiring digital fashion items and metaverse objects/lands to personalize our digital life further.

# **Vision**

## “In a world which is getting more and more digital, we want to offer individuals a place where to expand their identities beyond physical boundaries via the collection of digital collectibles”

# Mission

## “To sustain our vision, we think it is key to build a tech platform bringing high-end retail experiences to the digital collectible world, a platform enriched with a meaningful and curated set of products over a wide range of categories”
