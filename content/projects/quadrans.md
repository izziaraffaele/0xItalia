The first version of Quadrans blockchain was implemented in 2012 and has been successfully
used to run business operations under the Foodchain brand.

During this journey, the experience gained by the variety of use cases and the expertise shared by businesses, institutions, government agencies and academic partners have contributed to the evolution of Quadrans technology.

Quadrans is an open-source, public, decentralized platform enabled by blockchain technology
with the mandate to build a digital infrastructure that combines customizable data sharing,
cryptography and smart-contract automation and establish a self-governed digital economy
between businesses, institutions and individuals globally.

The aim of Quadrans Foundation is the research and development, promotion, education and
support of the Quadrans blockchain, to enable a trusted and efficient communication network to
facilitate the creation of global cross-industry standards and provide the digital fabric for the deployment of a new generation of decentralized applications (DApps) into the IoT system.
