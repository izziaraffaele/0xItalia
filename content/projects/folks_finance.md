Folks Finance is a non-custodial DeFi protocol providing financial tools for digital assets. Smart-contract technology empowers Folks Finance to offer advanced strategies while eliminating risks of centralized interference. Users can deposit assets to earn yield, as well as use their deposits as collateral for loans. Integration of the Deflex DEX aggregator enables native swaps on the protocol and composability with the other operations. Flash loans give developers the keys to deep liquidity. Algo Liquid Governance provides the most efficient method of participating in Algorand Governance through gALGO, whose use cases continue to expand rapidly.
